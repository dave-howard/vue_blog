## I am doing this for personal gain
Yes thats right - I am doing this for selfish reasons

#### Wait, what?
Let me expand on that a bit...

I think that if I write a blog it will help me in several ways:
- it is an excuse to create a technical thing that is *my own* and learn along the way
- the attempt to articulate my ideas and thoughts, helps me get those thoughts ironed out in my head
- I hope a blog will create a little community engagement for me, outside of work

#### but also

- as I am a decent person really; I do hope other people find it is useful, inspiring, thoughful, or at least a good read whilst waiting for the bus,

#### So let me expand on those points a bit...

**Creating a *technical thing* that is my own:**

I create lots of things at work, but they are not my own. When I am on corporate time I do things cost effectively, following corporate standards, in a low risk approach. That's not a great environment to learn new skills.

For this blog I am creating a new site using AWS Amplify, Vue.js, AWS Lambda etc. - I am sure I could find many easier ways to do create a blog with a simple google search - but the learning is the point here. *I love learning new things.*

My plan is to blog about and share what I learn along the way - I might even open source what I create (I also might not).

**Articulating ideas:**

I am a big believer that a great way to learn is to teach - the act of thinking about something so that you can explain it as clearly as possible to someone else clarifies those same ideas in your head. I also sometimes highlights things you don't really understand.

**Community engagement**

I love a good natter about interesting tech, and I will writing about things that I find interesting. So... I should probably think about adding a comments feature on this site... hmmm... maybe I should have gone with Wordpress?
